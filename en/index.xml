      <description>To get started Adno is a IIIF image editor/viewer project. Eventually, it will allow to annotate and create stories on these images, to share them too.
For the moment, on the home page, it is only possible to create annotations, view them, modify them, but not to save them.
 Creating annotations Shift key then click and drag to select an area, possibly enter a note, then save by clicking on OK.</description>
